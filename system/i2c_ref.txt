Read Only (RO) & Write Only (WO) Register Descriptions

0x00-0x07   Version (ASCII Version #)
0x08-0x0F   Vendor (ASCII Vendor “VEX”)
0x10-0x18   Device ID (ASCII Device ID)
0x20           Read Device Information
- 0x20 is now an auto incrementing address
-Byte0 Version #
-Byte1 Type (1: IME)
-Byte2 Board Id (2: Small IME, 3: Large IME)
-Byte3 Device Status
-Bit 0 Termination (0:Not Terminated, 1:Terminated)
-Bit 1 Overflow (0:No Overflow, 1:Overflow Occurred)
-Bit 2 Diagnostic Mode (0:off, 1:on)
-Bit 3-4 Direction (0=Idle, 1=CW, 2=CCW)
-Bits 5-7 N/A

0x3E-0x3F Read Signed Velocity (16bits)
-Byte0 Velocity bits 15-08 (Msb)
-Byte1 Velocity bits 07-00 (Lsb)
0x40-0x43 Read Rotation Bits 48bits (0xXXFFFF)
-Byte0 Rotation tics bits 15-08 (Msb)
-Byte1 Rotation tics bits 07-00 (Lsb)
-Byte2 Rotation tics bits 31-24 (Msb)
-Byte3 Rotation tics bits 23-16 (Lsb)
0x44-0x45 Read Unsigned Velocity (16bits)
-Byte0 Velocity bits 15-08 (Msb) 
-Byte1 Velocity bits 07-00 (Lsb)
0x46-0x47 Read Upper Rotation Bits (0xFFXXXX)
-Byte0 Rotation tics bits 47-40 (Msb)
-Byte1 Rotation tics bits 39-32 (Lsb)

0x4A (WO) Clear Device Counters 
0x4B (WO) Disable Terminator (so next device on chain can be seen)
0x4C (WO) Enable Terminator (Default, device is last in chain)
0x4D (WO) Change device address
-Byte0 New address (Range from 0x20 – 0x5E) *** Note: if the device is reset it will revert to factor default address

Scratch Pad Area Registers

0x60-9B (RO) Read Scratch Pad Data (60 bytes)
0xA0-DB (WO) Write Scratch Pad Data (60 bytes)
LED Patterns

Yellow - Not Initialized (default Address)

Every 3 sec
Green Blink - initialized, valid I2C communications, in neutral 
Green Double Blink - initialized, valid I2C communications, in neutral and terminated 

Blinking Green - relative to speed
Solid Green - full speed in either direction

Yellow (same as Green patterns) - counter overflow

Solid Red - data is being written to EEprom (1sec)
Blinking Red - address range error (a valid address will clear error)

Green Blip - I2C communications lost, initialized and in neutral 
Green Double Blip - I2C communications lost, initialized, neutral and terminated 
Electrical Logic Characteristics

The IME is meant to be supplied by 5V, but can be supplied by 3.3V, although this is largely untested. Logical high is Vddx0.7, meaning that at 5V the logic high is 3.5V and at 3.3V the logic high is 2.31V.
